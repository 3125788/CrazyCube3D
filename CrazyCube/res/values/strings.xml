	<string name="fl_1_2">2.Solution method is, rotate the side with red color to up side, and rotate up side until the side color same as center color, and then rotate 180° return to bottom.</string>
	<string name="fl_1_3">3.Repeat the step 2, until the target status attained to is shown as diagram.</string>
	<string name="fl_2_1">1.The target of this step is to complete bottom side(with red color), and the four sides become to anti-T shapes at the same time.Gray color representative don\'t pay attention to the color of the Rubik\'s cube</string>
	<string name="fl_2_2">2.Turn the corner piece with red color to the up layer (Attention:not the up side, but the up layer) ,then rotate the up side, until the another color of corner piece is the same to the center color of around side, and then rotate back.</string>
	<string name="fl_2_3">3.Notice:The step doesn\'t have standard solution method, you can observe our suggestion solution method carefully.</string>
	<string name="fl_3_1">1.The target of this step is to complete bottom side(red color), and the 2 layer of bottom.</string>
	<string name="fl_3_2">2.Rotate the up side, find out a position to appear the circumstance from the same color that the left diagram shows(Attention:the up side color shouldn\'t be purple color);Take left diagram as an example, the center pieces with green, the green color already tri-connect together(if not, then rotate up side, you can find out similar situation)</string>
	<string name="fl_3_3">3.As above the diagram shows, move the green-white piece to white-purple piece\'s position.You can use formula:URurufUF, the detail solution as below:</string>

	<string name="fl_3_notice">Attention:the key of this step is exactly identify the status of Rubik\'s cube, and then use the correct formula.</string>
	<string name="fl_4_1">1.Now, the two layer of bottom already recovered completely, the target is complete the X shape on up side.Gray color represents you shouldn\'t care.</string>
	<string name="fl_4_2">2.At this time, the Rubik\'s cube status should be the one of the three status, and whatever in such status, you can arrive the next status with the same formula (rufUFR), until the up side become x shape.</string>

	<string name="fl_5_2">2.Observation carefully, if is the situation of left diagram, that is the purple pieces towards un-clockwise, you can use way A</string>
	<string name="fl_5_3">3.The detail solution of way A as below, and the formula is ruRuru2R</string>

	<string name="fl_5_6">6.When the status not in way A and B, the Rubik\'s cube should placed in following status:</string>
	<string name="fl_5_7">7.If you meet 3 to 7 situation, please remember a key, that is 2 left 4 back.Choose a pieces that up-side isn\'t green color, and put it the topmost side (back-left corner), if there have 2 greens pieces not at up-side (3-5 circumstances), let the theest above of that of green dynasty left side, if none of 4 greens at up-side(6 with 7 circumstances), you should let the green pieces towards back side, then use way A, the 3-7 circumstances will become the sitatuation that way A or B include.</string>
	<string name="fl_5_notice">Attention:the key of this step is identify the 4 status exactly, and then use way A or B</string>
	<string name="fl_6_1">1.Now, the up side\'s color have been the same, and the four corner pieces are all placed in correct position, at most only have 4 pieces not in the correct position.</string>

	<string name="b_2_3">In this step, we always make great effort to combine the close side block and corner block together. The ability of trace the moving of block is very important.\r\nWhile doing the first side-corner block piece,  don\'t need to look for the most suitable block for start, as long as the first block you have seen.\r\nThe second side block simple some, because the M layer can arbitrarily rotation.\r\nStep two suitable for right hand, because don\'t disrput the step 1, we can use U, R, M and r operation arbitrarily, and the F and B operation that can go against.\r\nAccording to the formula of  U, R, M and r may be a little more steps, but the advantage is also very obvious:\r\n\t1. don\'t need loosen left hand, don\'t need whole rotation\r\n\t2. the right hand very vivid\r\n\t3. less thinking time</string>

	<string name="b_4_6">There have two basic form, that is the wrong color are a FD, UF, UL, UR(M\'UM and M\'U\'M and M\'UM\', M\'U\'M\') and symmetry BD and UB, UL and UR respectively.\r\nFlow these  3 step, pleases comprehension with it:\r\n\t1.

	<string name="b_4_7">Pls keep in memory for the five kinds of formulae:Two kinds of basic circumstances, UF and UL, UF and UB,  and the 4 side block on up side.\r\nThe situation that there have one wrong block on U side or D side. use U operation to let the wrong block not in M layer, and use M2 operation can immediately change into the above-mentioned circumstance.\r\nThe situation that there have two wrong blocks both in U side and D side. If the two 2 blocks is center symmetry, then use U operation once, and then M2 operation, it will change to 4 side block on up side; if the two blocks is not center symmetry, then M2 and U（or U\'） operation  can change into two kinds of basic circumstances.\r\nAs for the wrong block are all in down side, use M2 operation.</string>
